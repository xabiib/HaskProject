# Simple Course Registration - Haskell Project.

The simple Course Registration system is a simple yet complete management project. Haskell programming language and Visual Studio code are the core elements for its completion. 
Also, this project uses the SQLite database as backend support for storing student and course information. 

This project assumes some basic knowledge of Haskell. If you don't have that, I recommend Learn You a Haskell for Great Good http://learnyouahaskell.com/. Also, if you haven't already, install the Haskell Platform.https://www.haskell.org/downloads/.

You can install SQLite-simple from Hackage with:

cabal install sqlite-simple.

The best way to start this project is to clone and poke it around.

git clone https://github.com/xabiib/HaskProject.git
